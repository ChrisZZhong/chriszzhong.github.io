## TDD (Test Driven Development)

### What is TDD?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

### What are the benefits of using TDD?

analyze the requirement first, make sure we have the accurate and clean implementation

## Zero Downtime Deployment

### What is Zero Downtime Deployment?

Zero Downtime Deployment is a software deployment process that allows new versions of an application to be deployed without causing any downtime or disruption to the end users. It ensures that the application remains available and responsive throughout the deployment process.

### Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-Green Deployment is a software deployment process that allows new versions of an application to be deployed alongside the existing version, and then switch traffic from the old version to the new version without causing any downtime or disruption to the end users.

### Canary Deployment

Canary Deployment is a software deployment process that allows new versions of an application to be deployed to a small subset of users, and then gradually rolled out to a larger audience. It allows developers to test new features and changes in a controlled and incremental manner.
