# Thread

## Create a thread

1. Implement Runnable interface or extend Thread class

   Generally, we use Runnable interface instead of Thread class

   1. Thread class implements the runnable interface, when extending the Thread class, we only override the run() method of Runnable instead of all, this is a violation of `IS-A` Thread principle.
   2. Another is after extending Thread class, we `canâ€™t extend` another class.

2. Callable and Future

   Callable is similar to Runnable, but it can `return a result` and `throw a checked exception`.

   The Future interface represents the result of Thread. When the thread is executed, we can get the result of the thread through the Future object.

   **`DownSide`**: Threads should be independent, but Callable will block the main thread, so we need to use CompletableFuture to solve this problem.

3. CompletableFuture

   We can use CompletableFuture instead of implementing
   Runnable interface to create new threads, but under the hood, it still uses the Runnable to implement the multi-threading.

   Use Filterchain to handle the result of the thread.

   `ExecutorService` is a thread pool, which can manage the life cycle of threads, and can submit tasks to the thread pool for execution. Generally, we can use `ExecutorService` to run Runnable, Callable, CompletableFuture threads.
