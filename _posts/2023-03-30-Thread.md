# Thread [See Here](https://ducmanhphan.github.io/2020-02-10-How-to-use-CompletableFuture-Callable-in-Java/)

## Create a thread

Generally, we can create a thread in two ways: Implement `Runnable` interface or extend `Thread` class.

But we use Runnable interface instead of Thread class, because:

1.  Thread `implements` runnable, when extending Thread, we only override run() method. this is a violation of `IS-A` principle.

2.  `After extending` Thread class, we can't extend other classes.

Example:

```Java
Runnable task = () -> someReallyLongProcess();
Executor executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.execute(task);
```

We need to access the result and when bug happens, we need to know the message of the exception. But `Runnable` can not `return the result` and `throw exception`, so we can use `Callable` and `Future` to solve this problem.

## Callable and Future

### Callable

`Callable` is a functional interface, which has only one method call(). Callable is similar to Runnable, but Callable can return the result and throw exception.

```Java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Callable<V> {

   V call() throws Exception;

}
```

`Executor` only accepts `Runnable`, so we need to use `ExecutorService` to run the `Callable` thread.

```Java
public interface ExecutorService extends Executor {

   // Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a Future representing the pending results of the task.
   <T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);

   // Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future representing that task.
   Future<?> submit(Runnable task);

   // Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future representing that task.
   <T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result);
}
```

### Future

The `Future` represents the result of Thread. When thread executed, the result or the exception message will be stored in the Future for main thread to access.

```Java
// In the main thread
Callable<String> task = () -> buildPatientReport();
Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);

String result = future.get();   // blocking here until finished to get the result
```

**`DownSide`**: Threads should be independent, also we need multi-threads to improve the performance, but `Future` will `block` the main thread, so we need to use CompletableFuture to solve this problem.

## CompletableFuture

`CompletableFuture` is almost the same as a Future object with more methods and more capabilities. (`runnable`, `supplier`)

```java
Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Hello world");
ExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<?> future = service.submit(task);    // use future object
CompletableFuture<Void> completableFuture = CompletableFuture.runAsync(task);
```

`CompletableFuture` do not support `Callable`, only support `Runnable` and `Supplier` .

```java
Supplier<String> task = () -> readPage("https://google.com");
ExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(task);
```

Future chain to handle the results:

```java
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(task);
CompletableFuture<Integer> lengthFuture = completableFuture.thenApply(String::length).thenApply(len -> len * 2).exceptionally(ex -> 0);
```

## ExecutorService

`ExecutorService` is a thread pool used to manage threads, and can submit tasks to the thread pool for execution. Generally, we can use `ExecutorService` to run Runnable, Callable, CompletableFuture threads.

Advantage:

- easy to manage threads and reuse threads, which can reduce the overhead of thread creation and improve performance.

- can limit the number of threads, avoid too many threads to cause system crash.

Disadvantage:

- a careless threads pool size can halt the system and bring performance down

- Always shut down the executor service after tasks are completed and service is no lon..ger needed. Otherwise, JVM will never terminate.
