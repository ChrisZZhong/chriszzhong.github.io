# Spring

## Spring Framework (IOC)

Core feature is **`Dependency Injection (IOC)`** - Invert the control of creating objects to the framework.

### IOC Container types

- `BeanFactory` : lazy loaded, XML
- `ApplicationContext` : eager loaded, XML & annotation

### IOC Container life cycle

- IOC container `instantiate` when spring application starts
- Read the `bean` class from config files such as XML or annotations like @ComponentScan
- `Create` bean instance based on the Bean definition
- inject the Bean when required
- Post-processor `callback` methods, postProcessBeforeInitialization and postProcessAfterInitialization are called for monitor works or proxying.

### Bean & Bean scopes

Bean is object managed by Spring IOC container. use `@Scope` to specify the scope of the bean.

- `Singleton` : `default scope` only created once during Spring application run time
- `Prototype` : new instance per request
- `Request` : new instance per HTTP request
- `Session` : new instance per HTTP session
- `GlobalSession` : new instance per global HTTP session

### Dependency Injection (Ambiguous)

- `Constructor` : `@Autowired` on the constructor (inject immutable class)
- `Setter` : `@Autowired` on the setter method (when circular dependency exist)
- `Field` : `@Autowired` on the field (tight coupling, not recommended)

If there are multiple beans that implement the same interface, the container will not know which one to inject, We can use `@Primary` to determine which bean has higher priority, or use `@Qualifier` to specify an exact bean

## Spring Boot (auto configuration)

`Spring Boot`'s core feature is **`Auto Configuration`**, which is used to reduce the time for setting up configurations.

1. `Pom` file, spring Boot will generate default dependencies for us like `security`, `web`, `JDBC`.

2. `application.properties` file, we can `override` the default configuration by providing the `key-value` pairs in the application.properties file. like the data source url, username, password.

3. `@SpringBootApplication`

   - `@EnableAutoConfiguration` : Allows auto configuration based on the .jar dependencies in the pom.xml file

   - `@ComponentScan` : scan the `@Component` and their child class like @Controller, @Repository under the basic folder.

   - `@Configuration` : Spring Boot will only scan @Bean third party class under the @Configuration class. This is used to add extra beans to the spring container.

## Spring MVC

1. DispatcherServlet (central servlet) `map the request` to the corresponding controller method.

2. Data is processed In controller, service, dao, and then return to the controller.

3. Controller create `model object` contains the data in a `key-value` pair way. Controller will return a string of the view name to the `view resolver`.

4. View resolver has two responsibilities

   - `prefix` and `suffix` to the view name to find the jsp page

   - reach the template to replace the variables with the data in the model object.

## Spring AOP

AOP is used to **decouple cross-cutting concerns** from the core business logic. (e.g. logging, exception handling) **using `proxy` to wrap the object being called.** intercept the calls and add extra functionality before or after the method call.

- `Join point` **it is the `unit of point` can be monitored.**

- `Pointcut` is a predicate or expression that matches join points. It is a `set of join points` where `advice` should be executed.

- `Advice` is the `action` executed on join points. Different types - `before`, `after`, `after-returning`, `after-throwing`, and `around`.

- `Aspect` is a module that encapsulates join points, pointcuts, and advice. It is a class that implements cross-cutting concerns.

## Spring Security

Framework to protect our endpoints.

1. Login in with username and password:

- UserDetailsService `loadUserByUsername()` to load user information from database, and then compare the credentials.

- AuthenticationManager `authenticate()` to authenticate the user and generate `UserDetails` object with GrantedAuthority.

- Generate token with UserDetails.

2. user want to access the endpoint with token: first it will be filtered by the filter chain.

- JwtTokenUtil resolve() the token from request and generate the `userDetails` object.

- generate authentication object and set the authentication object to SecurityContext.

For authroization, we can use `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")` or `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('unverified')")` to check the role of the user. Also, we can use `@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails userDetails` to get the user details in the controller.

## JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is a standard that allows you to encode data in a JSON format. It is often used to encode authentication information, like the username, the permissions, etc. It is often used in combination with OAuth2.

JWT mainly contains three parts:

- Header: `Hashing algorithm` used to sign the token.
- Payload: contains the `claims` like userId, the permissions, etc.
- Signature: is used to `verify` that the `sender` of the JWT and to ensure that the message wasnâ€™t changed along the way. (Created by hashing the header and the payload with a secret key)

## Cache - (stale data)

Problem: When we update the data in the database, the cache is not updated. So the data in the cache is stale.

- Set expiration times for cached items.
- Use `@CacheEvict` to remove the cache when updating the data.
- Use `@CachePut` to update the cache when updating the data.

# Microservices

## API Gateway

API Gateway is a `single entry point` for all the microservices. `Route requests` to the appropriate microservice. It is not necessary, but it is good for `decoupling` and `load balancing` (round robin).

## Microservices Debug (Logging & Distributed Tracing)

- Centralized logging: `ELK` (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to centralize the logs from different microservices.

- Distributed tracing: `Zipkin`, use Zipkin to trace the request from the client to the microservices.

When Bug happens, we can use the `traceId` to trace the request from the client to the microservices. Then we can use the `traceId` to search the logs in the ELK to find the bug.

## Kafka

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is designed for high-throughput, and real-time data processing.

**Broker, Topic, Partition, Producer, Consumer, Consumer group, zookeeper**

## Fault-Tolerance

Enables system to continue `works` though there are some `failures` inside of it.

The more faults a system can tolerate without failing, the more fault-tolerant it is.

- `Circuit breakers` can prevent repeated requests to a failing service, allowing it time to recover.

- Timeouts can prevent a service from waiting too long for a response from another service. Fail fast is better than waiting indefinitely.

- `load balancers` : `avoid routing traffic` to unhealthy instances.

## RESTFul API 6 principles

1. `Uniform Interface` : requests looks same

2. `Client-Server decoupling` : client and server `independent`of each other. Client - `user interface` and server - `backend data storage`. Communicate through REST API.

3. `Stateless` : `server X store client data`. Each request contain all the information needed.

4. `Cacheability` : When possible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server side.

5. `Layered System` : Client does not need to know the internal structure (server / intermediary).

6. `Code on demand` : The server can provide executable code or scripts for the client to execute in its context.

## SOAP

SOAP is a protocol that uses XML to exchange information between computers over the Internet. It is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services. Compared to REST, SOAP is more difficult to implement and requires more bandwidth and resources.

Soap document need to have a root element called `<Envelope>`, which is required, and `<Header>` and `<Body>`, which are optional.

1. Header: contains routing and processing information.
2. Body: contains the actual message.

## JDBC & statement

JDBC is a Java API used to connect and execute query to the database.
It uses JDBC statements to execute queries.

There are three types of JDBC statements:

- `Statement`: Used to execute static SQL statements with no parameters. Actually we can pass parameters by concatenating strings, but this is not recommended because it is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Such as `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR 1=1;` will return all the users. So we should use `PreparedStatement` instead.

- `PreparedStatement`: Used to execute static SQL statements with parameters. we can use `?` to represent the parameters, and then use `setXXX()` method to set the parameters. It can prevent SQL injection attacks.

- `CallableStatement`: Used to execute stored procedures in database.

```Java
public static List<Trainee> getTraineesByPhoneNumber(String phone){
   List<Trainee> trainees = new ArrayList<>();

   // set up the connection
   Connection conn = null;
   PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;

   try {
      // Register JDBC driver, open a connection
      Class.forName(JDBC_DRIVER);
      conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASSWORD);

      // Execute a query
      String query = "select * from trainee where phoneNumber = ? ";
      preparedStatement = conn.prepareStatement(query);
      preparedStatement.setString(1, phone);

      ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();

      // retrieve data from result set row by row
      while (resultSet.next()) {
            int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
            String firstName = resultSet.getString("firstName");
            String lastName = resultSet.getString("lastName");
            String phoneNumber = resultSet.getString("phoneNumber");
            String ssn = resultSet.getString("ssn");

            Trainee trainee = new Trainee(id, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, ssn);
            trainees.add(trainee);
      }
      resultSet.close();
      // Clean-up environment, handle exceptions
   } catch (ClassNotFoundException | SQLException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
   } finally {
      try {
            if (conn != null) {
               conn.close();
            }
            if (preparedStatement != null) {
               preparedStatement.close();
            }
      } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }

   return trainees;
}
```

### Transaction Management

`Transaction` is a set of operations that are executed as a single unit of work. If one operation fails, the whole transaction fails. In JDBC, the Connection interface provides methods to manage transactions. There are three methods in the Connection interface: `setAutoCommit()`, `commit()` and `rollback()`.

```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {

   Connection conn = null;
   Statement statement = null;

   try {
      Class.forName(JDBC_DRIVER);
      conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASSWORD);
      statement = conn.createStatement();

      // 1. setAutoCommit(false) to disable auto-commit mode
      conn.setAutoCommit(false);

      String query = "update Bank set balance = 100 where accountName = 'April'";
      statement.executeUpdate(query);
      // ... several other executions

      // 2. setAutoCommit false all the operations are grouped together and committed at once
      conn.commit();
      System.out.println("Transaction successfully committed");
      System.out.println(getCurrentBalances(statement));

   }
   catch (ClassNotFoundException | SQLException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
   }
   catch (RuntimeException e) {
      try {
            System.out.println("rolling back ...");
            if (conn != null) {
               // 3. rollback if any exception occurs
               conn.rollback();
            }
      } catch (SQLException e1) {
            e1.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
   finally {
      try {
            if (conn != null) {
               conn.close();
            }
            if (statement != null) {
               statement.close();
            }
      } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

## JDBCTemplate

`JDBCTemplate` is a class in Spring JDBC, which is used to simplify the use of JDBC and avoid repetitive code.

All we need to do is pass the `SQL statment`, `RowMapper` and `parameters` to the `JDBCTemplate` object, and then it will fetch the data from database and convert it to the object according to the rowmapper.

main methods:

- `queryForObject`: return a single object
- `query`: return a list of objects
- `update`: update the database

## Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) framework, which is used to map the object-oriented domain model to the relational database.

### ORM

To configure Hibernate:

- Add the dependency in pom.xml

- Configure hibernate, we need a Hibernate `Configuration class`, inside it, we need to create a `sessionFactory` with the `dataSource`.

- Create entity class using `@Entity` and `@Table`, `@Id`, `@Column` `@GeneratedValue` to map objects to the database.

- To use it, we call sessionFactory.getCurrentSession to perform operations.

- To handle transactions, we can use @Transactional provided by Spring to handle transactions.

### Migration between different databases

Change database URL, driver, username, password, dialect

Dialect is used to generate the SQL statement according to the typr of database.

Driver is used to set up the connection between the application and the database.

### Entity State

- `transient` state, the entity instance is not attached to a session and has no corresponding rows in the database. It's usually just a new object that has been created to save to the database.

- `persistent` state, the entity instance is associated with a unique Session object (object already mapped to the database). Upon flushing the Session to the database, the entity is guaranteed to have a corresponding consistent record in the database.

- `detached` states, the entity instance was once attached to a Session, but now itâ€™s not. An instance enters this state if it is evicted from the context, clear or close the Session, or put the instance through serialization/deserialization process.

### Fetching Strategies

- `Eager`: will fetch all attributes of an entity at once, including Aggregation / Composition.

- `Lazy`: **`Default`** will load the Aggregation / Composition fields only when requested. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data retrieved from the database

`LazyInitializationException` occurs when accessing a lazily-loaded proxy outside the session. Hibernate is unable to fetch the data because the session has been closed. We can use eager fetching to prevent this from happening, or manually initialize the collection before the session closes.

### Hibernate Caching

There are two level Caching in Hibernate:

- `First level` cache provides caching at the session level. It is enabled by default. When you load an entity using a Session, Hibernate checks the first-level cache first to see if the entity is already loaded. If it's found in the cache, Hibernate returns the cached object, avoiding a database query. We can use session contains() to check if an obj is cached or not. get(). load() methods.

- `Second Level` cache is disabled by default, it is a higher level, cross-multi session. When query something, Hibernate will execute a query like select all fields from table where â€¦, and cache all objects in second level cache, when hibernate need to query object by id, it will first check the first level cache, if not contains, then check the second level cache, if not contains too, it will fetch from database and put it into the second level cache. Second level cache is only used for querying by ID of Hibernate objects.

## NoSQL & MongoDB

SQL databases based on relational data models. well-defined structure with clear relationships and constraints

NoSQL (not only sql) databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph. They provide flexible schemas that allow for dynamic and unstructured data. Like mongoDB, redis, Bigtable

Use Relational database:

- needs strong transactional support
- data has a well-defined structure with clear relationships
- requires complex queries involving multiple tables, joins, and aggregations

Use Non-Relational DB:

- Data is unstructured, like LinkedIn, user profile, each user may have different sections, if you put it in RDB, there will be many empty fields, so using Nosql will decrease the space and increase the speed for reading.
- Need high-speed read and write operations
- Distributed and Cloud Environments: NoSQL databases are well-suited for distributed and cloud-based architectures, allowing you to distribute data across multiple nodes or data centers.

## Mockito

`Mockito` is a `mocking framework` used for `unit testing` of Java applications. When we write unit tests, we need to mock the `external dependencies`. Mockito provide an easy way to mock the dependencies.

### Difference between `@Mock`, `@Spy`, `@InjectMocks`

`@Mock` is used to create and inject mocked instances. Often used to mock the dao layer. It will not call the real method inside.

`@InjectMocks` will inject the mocked instances into the tested object automatically. Often used to mock the service layer. It will call the real method inside. (suppose we are testing service layer, the service should be marked as `@InjectMocks`. becasue we need to run the logic inside each method)

`@Spy` is used to create and inject partially mocked instances. It will call the real method inside. It is used when we want to call the real method and perform some logic inside the method. like sending an email and then test if the email is sent successfully.

### What is the difference between `@Mock` and `@MockBean`? (same with `@Spy` and `@SpyBean`)

They both are used to create a fake object. `@Mock` create object not related to the spring framework.

When testing controller, it need us to start the Spring Boot application. We use `@MockBean` to create a fake object that is part of the Spring context. such as beans declared in the application's configuration or beans created by Spring Boot auto-configuration.
