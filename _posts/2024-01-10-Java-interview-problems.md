## Spring Framework (IOC)

Core feature is **`Dependency Injection (IOC)`** - Invert the control of creating objects to the framework.

### IOC Container types

- `BeanFactory` : lazy loaded, XML
- `ApplicationContext` : eager loaded, XML & annotation

### IOC Container life cycle

- IOC container `instantiate` when spring application starts
- Read the `bean` class from config files such as XML or annotations like @ComponentScan
- `Create` bean instance based on the Bean definition
- inject the Bean when required
- Post-processor `callback` methods, postProcessBeforeInitialization and postProcessAfterInitialization are called for monitor works or proxying.

### Bean & Bean scopes

Bean is object managed by Spring IOC container.

- `Singleton` : `default scope` only created once during Spring application run time
- `Prototype` : new instance per request
- `Request` : new instance per HTTP request
- `Session` : new instance per HTTP session
- `GlobalSession` : new instance per global HTTP session

## Spring Boot (auto configuration)

`Spring Boot`'s core feature is **`Auto Configuration`**, which is used to reduce the time for setting up configurations.

1. `Pom` file, spring Boot will generate default dependencies for us like `security`, `web`, `JDBC`.

2. `application.properties` file, we can `override` the default configuration by providing the `key-value` pairs in the application.properties file. like the data source url, username, password.

3. `@SpringBootApplication`

   - `@EnableAutoConfiguration` : Allows auto configuration based on the .jar dependencies in the pom.xml file

   - `@ComponentScan` : scan the `@Component` and their child class like @Controller, @Repository under the basic folder.

   - `@Configuration` : Spring Boot will only scan @Bean third party class under the @Configuration class. This is used to add extra beans to the spring container.

## Spring MVC

1. DispatcherServlet (central servlet) `map the request` to the corresponding controller method.

2. Data is processed In controller, service, dao, and then return to the controller.

3. Controller create `model object` contains the data in a `key-value` pair way. Controller will return a string of the view name to the `view resolver`.

4. View resolver has two responsibilities

   - `prefix` and `suffix` to the view name to find the jsp page

   - reach the template to replace the variables with the data in the model object.

## Spring AOP

AOP is used to **decouple cross-cutting concerns** from the core business logic. (e.g. logging, exception handling) **using `proxy` to wrap the object being called.** intercept the calls and add extra functionality before or after the method call.

- `Join point` **it is the `unit of point` can be monitored.**

- `Pointcut` is a predicate or expression that matches join points. It is a `set of join points` where `advice` should be executed.

- `Advice` is the `action` executed on join points. Different types - `before`, `after`, `after-returning`, `after-throwing`, and `around`.

- `Aspect` is a module that encapsulates join points, pointcuts, and advice. It is a class that implements cross-cutting concerns.

## Spring Security

Framework to protect our endpoints.

1. Login in with username and password:

- UserDetailsService `loadUserByUsername()` to load user information from database, and then compare the credentials.

- AuthenticationManager `authenticate()` to authenticate the user and generate `UserDetails` object with GrantedAuthority.

- Generate token with UserDetails.

2. user want to access the endpoint with token: first it will be filtered by the filter chain.

- JwtTokenUtil resolve() the token from request and generate the `userDetails` object.

- generate authentication object and set the authentication object to SecurityContext.

For authroization, we can use `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")` or `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('unverified')")` to check the role of the user. Also, we can use `@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails userDetails` to get the user details in the controller.

## JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is a standard that allows you to encode data in a JSON format. It is often used to encode authentication information, like the username, the permissions, etc. It is often used in combination with OAuth2.

JWT mainly contains three parts:

- Header: `Hashing algorithm` used to sign the token.

- Payload: contains the `claims` like userId, the permissions, etc.

- Signature: is used to `verify` that the `sender` of the JWT and to ensure that the message wasnâ€™t changed along the way. (Created by hashing the header and the payload with a secret key)
