**Situation:**
In my recent project at BOCUSA, I was responsible for refactoring an e-commerce backend service from SOAP to REST. One key feature was sending transactional emails to users based on the API input type—for example, sending a receipt email after a successful payment.

However, during peak hours (Black Friday), we started receiving incident reports where some users weren't getting their receipt emails, and others experienced significantly delayed page responses after payment. This created a poor user experience and impacted user trust. Specifically:
- 15% of users weren't receiving receipt emails
- Payment response times increased from 200ms to 3+ seconds
- Cart abandonment rate reached 8%

**Task:**
I was responsible for the SOAP-to-REST migration. The email service failure was blocking payment completion, directly impacting customer trust and revenue. I needed to:
1. Identify the root cause of the performance issues
2. Design a solution that doesn't break existing functionality
3. Implement the fix without service downtime
4. Ensure the system can handle future traffic spikes

**Action:**
1. **Deep Analysis with Data**:
   - Reviewed Splunk logs with tracing IDs to track requests across gateway, backend, and MQ layers
   - Analyzed legacy code to understand the email flow
   - Discovered that email functionality was directly embedded in the payment service and used SMTP for sending emails
   - Identified that email logic was tightly coupled and synchronous—the system would wait for the email to be sent before completing the payment flow
   - Under high traffic (10x normal load), this became a bottleneck
   - The email service couldn't scale independently, leading to overload and failures

2. **Root Cause Identification**:
   - SMTP calls were blocking payment completion
   - No centralized logging in legacy system (started in 2008)
   - Tight coupling between payment and email services
   - System couldn't handle traffic spikes

3. **Solution Design**:
   - Proposed decoupling email functionality from payment flow using a message queue (Kafka)
   - This would allow payment processing to complete quickly while email sending could be handled asynchronously
   - Before implementing, consulted with team lead to check if we had existing infrastructure we could leverage
   - Fortunately, we already had a centralized notification service in production that supported scalable email delivery
   - This meant we didn't need to build and maintain a new service from scratch

4. **Validation**:
   - Collaborated with teammates to gather feedback and ensure alignment
   - Built a simplified prototype that demonstrated the asynchronous flow using the message queue and notification service
   - Prototype showed 90% latency reduction

5. **Implementation**:
   - Deployed async flow with monitoring and retry mechanisms
   - Set up dashboards to track email delivery rates and payment latency
   - Used feature flags for gradual rollout

**Result:**
- **Email-related incidents**: Reduced by 95%
- **Payment latency**: Dropped from 3s to 180ms (85% improvement)
- **Cart abandonment**: Decreased from 8% to 2.5% (68% improvement)
- **Scalability**: System now handles 10x traffic spikes without degradation
- **Reliability**: Improved system reliability and scalability
- **Business Impact**: Improved customer experience and prevented potential revenue loss during peak periods
- **Technical Impact**: Enhanced observability with Splunk integration and tracing IDs, making future debugging easier

**Key Takeaways:**
- Data-driven analysis is crucial for identifying root causes
- Leveraging existing infrastructure reduces implementation time and risk
- Async architecture is essential for scalable systems
- Proactive problem identification and ownership lead to better outcomes

   - I argued that even using Kafka, we still need to deploy it somewhere

2. **Colleague's Counter-Argument**:
   - My colleague suggested using Kafka instead
   - He was concerned about the potential risk of vendor lock-in
   - He made a valid point about the potential risks of relying solely on AWS, especially if some day AWS goes down
   - He believed that using Kafka offered more flexibility for future migrations, such as using GCP

3. **Discussion and Analysis**:
   - To address this, I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with him to discuss our viewpoints
   - During the meeting, I explained why I preferred AWS SQS
   - I listened to his perspective about vendor lock-in
   - We analyzed long-term implications: What if AWS goes down? What if we need multi-cloud?
   - I realized that his point about vendor lock-in was valid, especially for long-term scalability

4. **Decision and Commitment**:
   - Instead of being stubborn about my viewpoint, I chose to use Kafka
   - I fully committed to the Kafka implementation
   - We worked together to ensure successful deployment

**Result:**
- **Decision**: Chose Kafka for long-term flexibility
- **Performance**: Kafka efficiently handled the messages and enhanced the overall performance of our application

**适用问题：**
- Are Right: "Tell me about a time when you had to work with insufficient information or incomplete data" *(专有)*
- Bias for Action: "Tell me about a time when you required some information from somebody else, but they weren't responsive. What did you do?"
- Deliver Results: "Describe the most challenging situation in your life and how you handled it"

**Situation:**
This thing rarely happens to me. But when I was at Fiserv, there was a time I almost missed the deadline. I had a ticket to fix a high-severity vulnerability with a tight deadline, and while I was in the middle of debugging, I met a roadblock: something was wrong with an external API that the service called.

**Task:**
Fix the high-severity vulnerability on time despite external dependency failure and insufficient information.

**Action:**
1. **Limited Information Challenge**:
   - Only had service logs, no access to external API internals
   - The external API was failing, but I couldn't see what was happening inside it
   - I needed to understand if the issue was in our code or the external API

2. **Deep Analysis with Available Data**:
   - Fortunately, we had been paying close attention to the logs, which helped a lot to narrow down the scope
   - To figure out what happened, I debugged the logs of the service carefully
   - I made sure other functions in the service worked fine
   - Finally found that the API the server called does not work well as expected
   - At that point, I realized that the downtime could significantly delay my progress

3. **Proactive Communication**:
   - I reported the situation to my manager immediately
   - Explained the urgency of the situation and potential impact
   - At the same time, I reached out to the coworker responsible for that service
   - I explained the urgency of the situation to the API owner
   - We set up a meeting and estimated the recovery time together

4. **Collaboration and Contingency**:
   - Collaborated with the API owner to understand the issue
   - Estimated recovery time together
   - In the end, my manager rescheduled the deadline for my ticket based on the recovery estimate
   - Continued working on other parts of the ticket while waiting for API recovery

**Result:**
- **Timeline**: API recovered the next day, there was no significant impact on business
- **Delivery**: I was able to complete the ticket on time after recovery
- **Communication**: Kept everyone in the loop, preventing escalation
- **Learning**: The importance of good communication when working with incomplete information
- **Impact**: Prevented escalation and maintained team trust

**Key Takeaways:**
- Proactive communication is critical when working with incomplete information
- Deep analysis of available data can help isolate issues even without full visibility
- Collaboration with stakeholders helps manage expectations and timelines
- Keeping everyone in the loop prevents escalation and maintains trust
