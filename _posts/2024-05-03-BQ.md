   - Identified pattern: Slowdowns correlated with specific database queries
   - Traced to N+1 query problem in payment processing code
   
2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Found inefficient query: fetching payment details individually instead of batch
   - Quantified impact: Each payment triggered 10+ database queries instead of 1
   - Under peak load (1000 req/sec), this caused database connection pool exhaustion
   
3. **Solution Design**:
   - Refactored to batch queries using IN clause
   - Added database query caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implemented connection pooling optimization
   - Added query performance monitoring

In my recent project at BOCUSA, I was responsible for refactoring an e-commerce backend service from SOAP to REST. One key feature was sending transactional emails to users based on the API input type—for example, sending a receipt email after a successful payment.

However, during peak hours (Black Friday), we started receiving incident reports where some users weren't getting their receipt emails, and others experienced significantly delayed page responses after payment. This created a poor user experience and impacted user trust. Specifically:
- 15% of users weren't receiving receipt emails
- Payment response times increased from 200ms to 3+ seconds
- Cart abandonment rate reached 8%

**Task:**
I was responsible for the SOAP-to-REST migration. The email service failure was blocking payment completion, directly impacting customer trust and revenue. I needed to:
1. Identify the root cause of the performance issues
2. Design a solution that doesn't break existing functionality
3. Implement the fix without service downtime
4. Ensure the system can handle future traffic spikes

**Action:**
1. **Deep Analysis with Data**:
   - Reviewed Splunk logs with tracing IDs to track requests across gateway, backend, and MQ layers
   - Analyzed legacy code to understand the email flow
   - Discovered that email functionality was directly embedded in the payment service and used SMTP for sending emails
   - Identified that email logic was tightly coupled and synchronous—the system would wait for the email to be sent before completing the payment flow
   - Under high traffic (10x normal load), this became a bottleneck
   - The email service couldn't scale independently, leading to overload and failures

2. **Root Cause Identification**:
   - SMTP calls were blocking payment completion
   - No centralized logging in legacy system (started in 2008)
   - Tight coupling between payment and email services
   - System couldn't handle traffic spikes

3. **Solution Design**:
   - Proposed decoupling email functionality from payment flow using a message queue (Kafka)
   - This would allow payment processing to complete quickly while email sending could be handled asynchronously
   - Before implementing, consulted with team lead to check if we had existing infrastructure we could leverage
   - Fortunately, we already had a centralized notification service in production that supported scalable email delivery
   - This meant we didn't need to build and maintain a new service from scratch

4. **Validation**:
   - Collaborated with teammates to gather feedback and ensure alignment
   - Built a simplified prototype that demonstrated the asynchronous flow using the message queue and notification service
   - Prototype showed 90% latency reduction

5. **Implementation**:
   - Deployed async flow with monitoring and retry mechanisms
   - Set up dashboards to track email delivery rates and payment latency
   - Used feature flags for gradual rollout

**Result:**
- **Email-related incidents**: Reduced by 95%
- **Payment latency**: Dropped from 3s to 180ms (85% improvement)
- **Cart abandonment**: Decreased from 8% to 2.5% (68% improvement)
- **Scalability**: System now handles 10x traffic spikes without degradation
- **Reliability**: Improved system reliability and scalability
- **Business Impact**: Improved customer experience and prevented potential revenue loss during peak periods
- **Technical Impact**: Enhanced observability with Splunk integration and tracing IDs, making future debugging easier

**Key Takeaways:**
- Data-driven analysis is crucial for identifying root causes
- Leveraging existing infrastructure reduces implementation time and risk
- Async architecture is essential for scalable systems
- Proactive problem identification and ownership lead to better outcomes

Specifically, 15% of users weren't receiving receipt emails, payment response times increased from 200ms to 3+ seconds, and cart abandonment rate reached 8%.

I was responsible for the SOAP-to-REST migration, and the email service failure was blocking payment completion, directly impacting customer trust and revenue. I needed to identify the root cause, design a solution that doesn't break existing functionality, implement the fix without service downtime, and ensure the system can handle future traffic spikes.

I began by reviewing Splunk logs with tracing IDs to track requests across gateway, backend, and MQ layers. I analyzed the legacy code to understand the email flow and discovered that email functionality was directly embedded in the payment service and used SMTP for sending emails. The email logic was tightly coupled and synchronous—the system would wait for the email to be sent before completing the payment flow. Under high traffic, which was about 10x normal load, this became a bottleneck. The email service couldn't scale independently, leading to overload and failures.

The root cause was clear: SMTP calls were blocking payment completion. The legacy system, which started in 2008, had no centralized logging, and there was tight coupling between payment and email services. The system simply couldn't handle traffic spikes.

To solve this, I proposed decoupling email functionality from payment flow using a message queue, specifically Kafka. This would allow payment processing to complete quickly while email sending could be handled asynchronously. Before implementing, I consulted with my team lead to check if we had existing infrastructure we could leverage. Fortunately, we already had a centralized notification service in production that supported scalable email delivery, which meant we didn't need to build and maintain a new service from scratch.

I collaborated with teammates to gather feedback and ensure alignment. To validate the design, I built a simplified prototype that demonstrated the asynchronous flow using the message queue and notification service. The prototype showed 90% latency reduction.

For implementation, I deployed the async flow with monitoring and retry mechanisms, set up dashboards to track email delivery rates and payment latency, and used feature flags for gradual rollout.

The results were significant. Email-related incidents were reduced by 95%, payment latency dropped from 3 seconds to 180 milliseconds—that's an 85% improvement. Cart abandonment decreased from 8% to 2.5%, which is a 68% improvement. The system now handles 10x traffic spikes without degradation. We improved system reliability and scalability, enhanced customer experience, and prevented potential revenue loss during peak periods. Technically, we enhanced observability with Splunk integration and tracing IDs, making future debugging much easier.

This experience taught me that data-driven analysis is crucial for identifying root causes, leveraging existing infrastructure reduces implementation time and risk, async architecture is essential for scalable systems, and proactive problem identification and ownership lead to better outcomes.

2. **Colleague's Counter-Argument**:
   - My colleague suggested using Kafka instead
   - He was concerned about the potential risk of vendor lock-in
   - He made a valid point about the potential risks of relying solely on AWS, especially if some day AWS goes down
   - He believed that using Kafka offered more flexibility for future migrations, such as using GCP

3. **Discussion and Analysis**:
   - To address this, I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with him to discuss our viewpoints
   - During the meeting, I explained why I preferred AWS SQS
   - I listened to his perspective about vendor lock-in
   - We analyzed long-term implications: What if AWS goes down? What if we need multi-cloud?
   - I realized that his point about vendor lock-in was valid, especially for long-term scalability

4. **Decision and Commitment**:
   - Instead of being stubborn about my viewpoint, I chose to use Kafka
   - I fully committed to the Kafka implementation
   - We worked together to ensure successful deployment

**Result:**
- **Decision**: Chose Kafka for long-term flexibility
- **Performance**: Kafka efficiently handled the messages and enhanced the overall performance of our application

Instead of being stubborn about my viewpoint, I chose to use Kafka. I fully committed to the Kafka implementation, and we worked together to ensure successful deployment.

The decision turned out to be the right one. Kafka efficiently handled the messages and enhanced the overall performance of our application. More importantly, I learned that technical decisions should consider not just current requirements but future scalability and vendor independence. The system now supports multi-cloud architecture, reducing vendor dependency risk. This forward-thinking mindset is crucial for scalable systems, especially relevant for companies like Uber that operate at global scale.

I maintained a positive relationship with my colleague, and we made a better decision through collaboration. This experience taught me that long-term thinking is more important than short-term convenience, being wrong and learning from it leads to better decisions, open-mindedness and collaboration result in better outcomes, and vendor independence is important for global systems.

## Story: High-Priority Vulnerability Fix

**适用问题：**
- Are Right: "Tell me about a time when you had to work with insufficient information or incomplete data" *(专有)*
- Bias for Action: "Tell me about a time when you required some information from somebody else, but they weren't responsive. What did you do?"
- Deliver Results: "Describe the most challenging situation in your life and how you handled it"

**Situation:**
This thing rarely happens to me. But when I was at Fiserv, there was a time I almost missed the deadline. I had a ticket to fix a high-severity vulnerability with a tight deadline, and while I was in the middle of debugging, I met a roadblock: something was wrong with an external API that the service called.

**Task:**
Fix the high-severity vulnerability on time despite external dependency failure and insufficient information.

**Action:**
1. **Limited Information Challenge**:
   - Only had service logs, no access to external API internals
   - The external API was failing, but I couldn't see what was happening inside it
   - I needed to understand if the issue was in our code or the external API

2. **Deep Analysis with Available Data**:
   - Fortunately, we had been paying close attention to the logs, which helped a lot to narrow down the scope
   - To figure out what happened, I debugged the logs of the service carefully
   - I made sure other functions in the service worked fine
   - Finally found that the API the server called does not work well as expected
   - At that point, I realized that the downtime could significantly delay my progress

3. **Proactive Communication**:
   - I reported the situation to my manager immediately
   - Explained the urgency of the situation and potential impact
   - At the same time, I reached out to the coworker responsible for that service
   - I explained the urgency of the situation to the API owner
   - We set up a meeting and estimated the recovery time together

4. **Collaboration and Contingency**:
   - Collaborated with the API owner to understand the issue
   - Estimated recovery time together
   - In the end, my manager rescheduled the deadline for my ticket based on the recovery estimate
   - Continued working on other parts of the ticket while waiting for API recovery

**Result:**
- **Timeline**: API recovered the next day, there was no significant impact on business
- **Delivery**: I was able to complete the ticket on time after recovery
- **Communication**: Kept everyone in the loop, preventing escalation
- **Learning**: The importance of good communication when working with incomplete information
- **Impact**: Prevented escalation and maintained team trust

**Key Takeaways:**
- Proactive communication is critical when working with incomplete information
- Deep analysis of available data can help isolate issues even without full visibility
- Collaboration with stakeholders helps manage expectations and timelines
- Keeping everyone in the loop prevents escalation and maintains trust

During peak traffic, specifically Black Friday, our payment service was processing 50K+ transactions per hour. Response times spiked from 200ms to 3+ seconds, causing 8% cart abandonment. The system was hitting database connection pool limits and synchronous processing bottlenecks.

My task was to optimize payment processing to handle 10x traffic spikes while maintaining less than 200ms p99 latency, without service downtime.

I started with data-driven analysis. I analyzed Splunk metrics and identified database connection pool exhaustion as the primary bottleneck. I traced the request flow and discovered synchronous email processing was blocking payment completion. I quantified the impact: 15% of transactions were failing, and we had 8% cart abandonment.

For the architecture redesign, I implemented connection pooling optimization by increasing pool size and adding connection reuse. I decoupled email processing via Kafka message queue for async, non-blocking processing. I added circuit breakers for external dependencies and implemented request queuing with priority handling.

For validation and deployment, I load tested with 10x traffic simulation. The latency improvements were validated: p99 dropped from 3 seconds to 180 milliseconds. I deployed with feature flags and gradual rollout, going from 10% to 50% to 100%. I set up real-time monitoring dashboards to track performance.

The results were outstanding. Latency was reduced from 3 seconds to 180 milliseconds—that's a 94% improvement. Throughput increased dramatically: we handled 10x traffic spike, going from 50K to 500K transactions per hour. Reliability improved significantly: failures were reduced from 15% to 0.2%. Business impact was substantial: cart abandonment dropped from 8% to 2.5%, which is a 68% improvement. We estimated significant revenue savings during the peak period, and the system now handles peak traffic without degradation.

This is highly relevant to Uber because we handled massive traffic spikes similar to Uber's surge pricing scenarios. Payment processing is critical and real-time, like Uber's real-time ride matching. We used metrics to identify and validate solutions, and achieved quantifiable business metrics including cart abandonment and revenue impact.

   - Created shared documentation and API contracts
   - Established testing strategy: parallel run (SOAP + REST) for 2 weeks
   - Set up monitoring to track both old and new systems
   
3. **Problem-Solving**:
   - **Blocker 1**: Gateway team needed API contract changes
     - Solution: Scheduled design review, agreed on contract versioning strategy
   - **Blocker 2**: Testing infrastructure couldn't handle load
     - Solution: Built lightweight test harness, leveraged existing CI/CD
   - **Blocker 3**: Notification team had conflicting priorities
     - Solution: Escalated to managers, reprioritized their sprint
   
4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Implemented feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Set up rollback plan
   - Created runbook for incident response

5. **Motivating Teams**:

For cross-team coordination, I organized daily standups with all 3 teams. I created shared documentation and API contracts, established a testing strategy with parallel run of SOAP and REST for 2 weeks, and set up monitoring to track both old and new systems.

I encountered several blockers and solved them systematically. Blocker 1 was that the Gateway team needed API contract changes. I scheduled a design review and we agreed on a contract versioning strategy. Blocker 2 was that the testing infrastructure couldn't handle the load. I built a lightweight test harness and leveraged existing CI/CD. Blocker 3 was that the Notification team had conflicting priorities. I escalated to managers and reprioritized their sprint.

For risk mitigation, I implemented feature flags for gradual rollout, set up a rollback plan, and created a runbook for incident response.

When the Notification team wanted to give up due to conflicting priorities, I escalated to managers to reprioritize. I worked with the Gateway team to find a compromise using a versioning strategy. I broke down work into smaller milestones, provided support and removed blockers, and maintained momentum through daily standups.

The results exceeded expectations. We delivered 2 days ahead of deadline, saving 3 weeks. We had zero production incidents during migration. We achieved 100% coverage of legacy endpoints migrated. Performance improved: REST APIs were 30% faster than SOAP with reduced latency. We established a migration pattern used for future projects. Most importantly, we enabled mobile app release on schedule, supporting a new revenue stream. All teams committed and delivered despite initial challenges.

This demonstrates ownership by taking initiative beyond job scope, scale by coordinating multiple teams like Uber's cross-functional initiatives, impact by enabling business-critical feature launch, execution by delivering under pressure with high quality, and leadership by leading without formal authority.

Our e-commerce service was experiencing intermittent slowdowns during peak hours. Initial investigation showed no obvious issues, but customer complaints were increasing. We had Splunk logs but no clear performance metrics.

My task was to identify the root cause of performance issues and implement a solution to improve system reliability.

I started with a deep dive using data. I analyzed Splunk logs across over 1 million requests over 2 weeks. I created custom dashboards to track response times, error rates, and database query times. I identified a pattern: slowdowns correlated with specific database queries. I traced this to an N+1 query problem in payment processing code.

For root cause analysis, I found an inefficient query that was fetching payment details individually instead of in batch. I quantified the impact: each payment triggered 10+ database queries instead of 1. Under peak load of 1000 requests per second, this caused database connection pool exhaustion.

For solution design, I refactored to batch queries using IN clause. I added database query caching for frequently accessed data, implemented connection pooling optimization, and added query performance monitoring.

For validation, I load tested and reduced database queries by 90%, going from 10 queries to 1 query per request. I validated performance: p99 latency improved from 2 seconds to 150 milliseconds. I deployed with monitoring to track improvements.

The results were significant. Performance improved dramatically: p99 latency was reduced from 2 seconds to 150 milliseconds—that's a 92% improvement. Efficiency improved: database queries were reduced by 90%. Reliability improved: we eliminated intermittent slowdowns. Scalability improved: the system now handles 3x traffic without degradation. Cost was reduced: lower database load meant lower infrastructure costs. Customer impact was positive: complaints dropped by 95%. Innovation: the custom dashboards and monitoring tools I created are now used by the entire team.

This demonstrates data-driven decision making by using metrics and logs to identify root cause, scale by solving performance issues affecting high-traffic systems, impact through quantifiable improvements in latency, queries, and customer complaints, deep dive through thorough analysis of complex system behavior, and curiosity by investigating beyond initial symptoms to find root cause.

- Bias for Action: (可以作为补充)
- Ownership: (可以作为补充)

**Situation:**
I was in a situation where I had to handle multiple competing priorities simultaneously:
- Several features needed to be implemented and deployed within a short timeframe
- An urgent production issue occurred that required immediate attention
- I needed to coordinate with coworkers to discuss business requirements for upcoming features

This created a challenging scenario where I had to balance feature development, production stability, and cross-team collaboration, all with tight deadlines.

**Task:**
Manage multiple tasks effectively without compromising quality or missing deadlines. The key challenge was prioritizing and organizing work to ensure:
1. Critical production issues were addressed immediately
2. Feature development progressed on schedule
3. Business requirements were clarified through effective coordination
4. All deliverables maintained high quality standards

**Action:**
1. **Prioritization Strategy**:
   - Identified the most critical task: the production issue (highest priority)
   - Assessed dependencies and deadlines for feature work
   - Scheduled business requirement discussions around other work

2. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Broke down each feature into smaller, manageable pieces
   - Divided feature implementation into smaller development and testing phases
   - Prioritized sub-tasks based on deadlines and dependencies
   - This made it easier to focus on one sub-task at a time

3. **Production Issue Handling**:
   - Immediately addressed the most critical production problem
   - Communicated effectively with the team about the issue status
   - Ensured proper escalation and coordination for resolution

4. **Coordination and Communication**:
   - Scheduled focused meetings with coworkers to discuss business requirements
   - Used async communication (email, Slack) for non-urgent clarifications
   - Set clear expectations about response times and availability

5. **Time Management**:
   - Allocated specific time blocks for different types of work
   - Used time-boxing to ensure progress on all fronts
   - Avoided context switching by grouping similar tasks together

**Result:**
- **Production Issue**: Resolved quickly with effective team communication
- **Features**: All features implemented and deployed on time
- **Business Requirements**: Successfully coordinated and clarified requirements
- **Quality**: Maintained high quality across all deliverables
- **Learning**: Developed effective multitasking and prioritization skills
- **Impact**: Demonstrated ability to handle pressure and deliver results under multiple competing priorities

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prioritization is crucial when handling multiple tasks
- Breaking down tasks into smaller pieces makes them more manageable
- Effective communication is essential when coordinating with teams
- Focusing on critical issues first prevents escalation
- Gradual, systematic approach leads to high-quality outcomes

**Uber-Relevance:**

My task was to manage multiple tasks effectively without compromising quality or missing deadlines. The key challenge was prioritizing and organizing work to ensure critical production issues were addressed immediately, feature development progressed on schedule, business requirements were clarified through effective coordination, and all deliverables maintained high quality standards.

I started with a prioritization strategy. I identified the most critical task: the production issue had highest priority. I assessed dependencies and deadlines for feature work, and scheduled business requirement discussions around other work.

For task breakdown, I broke down each feature into smaller, manageable pieces. I divided feature implementation into smaller development and testing phases, prioritized sub-tasks based on deadlines and dependencies. This made it easier to focus on one sub-task at a time.

For production issue handling, I immediately addressed the most critical production problem. I communicated effectively with the team about the issue status and ensured proper escalation and coordination for resolution.

For coordination and communication, I scheduled focused meetings with coworkers to discuss business requirements. I used async communication like email and Slack for non-urgent clarifications, and set clear expectations about response times and availability.

For time management, I allocated specific time blocks for different types of work. I used time-boxing to ensure progress on all fronts, and avoided context switching by grouping similar tasks together.

The results were positive across all areas. The production issue was resolved quickly with effective team communication. All features were implemented and deployed on time. Business requirements were successfully coordinated and clarified. I maintained high quality across all deliverables. I developed effective multitasking and prioritization skills, and demonstrated ability to handle pressure and deliver results under multiple competing priorities.

This experience taught me that prioritization is crucial when handling multiple tasks, breaking down tasks into smaller pieces makes them more manageable, effective communication is essential when coordinating with teams, focusing on critical issues first prevents escalation, and a gradual, systematic approach leads to high-quality outcomes.

This is relevant to Uber because I handled multiple high-priority tasks simultaneously, similar to Uber's fast-paced environment. I delivered results across different areas without compromising quality, demonstrated ability to prioritize and execute under pressure, and showed effective coordination with multiple stakeholders.

## Story: Legacy Service Migration with Customer Resistance

**适用问题：**
- Customer Obsession: "Who was your most difficult customer?" *(专有)*
- Customer Obsession: "How do you go about prioritizing customer needs when you are dealing with a large number of customers?" *(专有)*
- Ownership: "Tell me about a time when you had to work on a task with unclear responsibilities" *(可以作为补充)*
- Think Big: (可以作为补充)
- Invent and Simplify: (可以作为补充)

**Situation:**
When I joined BOCUSA, I inherited a critical e-commerce payment service from a colleague who was leaving. This service handled credit card transactions for multiple child banks and credit unions. The service had significant technical and operational challenges:

- **Legacy Architecture**: Built on SOAP protocol, outdated technology stack
- **Poor Observability**: No detailed call-level logging, only basic server health monitoring
- **Difficult Troubleshooting**: When production issues occurred, it was extremely difficult to locate and resolve problems quickly
- **Customer Dissatisfaction**: Our customers (the banks and credit unions calling our API) had ongoing complaints about service reliability and our slow response times to issues
- **Team Context**: A new colleague was also assigned to this project, needing to understand the system quickly

The service was critical to our business, but the technical debt was impacting both our operations and customer satisfaction.

**Task:**
I needed to:
1. Understand the service deeply (business goals, technical implementation)
2. Improve system observability and reliability
3. Propose and execute a modernization plan
4. Ensure minimal disruption to customers who were already struggling with their own resource constraints
5. Balance technical improvements with customer needs and constraints

**Action:**
1. **Deep Understanding Phase (Months 1-3)**:
   - **Business Context**: Spent several months working with Business Analysts to understand the service's business goals and requirements
   - **Technical Deep Dive**: Studied the underlying codebase extensively to gain comprehensive understanding
   - **Customer Pain Points**: Identified that customers' main concerns were reliability and our slow issue resolution times

2. **Proposal and Planning**:
   - **Bold Initiative**: Recognizing the need for modernization and the opportunity to help my new colleague understand the system better, I proposed a RESTful refactoring to my leader
   - **Technical Benefits**: Explained how RESTful architecture would enable:
     - Splunk integration for detailed logging and monitoring
     - OpenShift deployment for dynamic scaling during peak hours
     - Better observability to reduce issue resolution time
   - **Leader Approval**: My leader agreed with the proposal

3. **Customer Engagement and Resistance**:
   - **Initial Communication**: Presented the RESTful migration plan to customers
   - **Customer Pushback**: Several customers rejected the proposal because:
     - It would require significant changes on their side
     - They had limited resources and couldn't handle additional workload
     - They were concerned about the migration effort and potential downtime
   - **Understanding Customer Constraints**: Recognized that forcing migration would create hardship for customers already struggling with resource constraints

4. **Innovative Solution Design**:
   - **SOAP-to-REST Translation Layer**: After multiple discussions with customers, I designed a solution that introduced a SOAP-to-REST translation service
   - **Minimal Customer Impact**: This translation layer would:
     - Map SOAP requests to REST requests automatically
     - Allow customers to continue using SOAP without any changes
     - Enable us to upgrade and modernize our backend service
   - **Gradual Migration Path**: Also provided RESTful API directly for customers who wanted to upgrade at their own pace

5. **Implementation**:
   - **Backend Modernization**: Upgraded and refactored the service to RESTful architecture
   - **Translation Service**: Implemented SOAP-to-REST translation layer in front of the new service
   - **Monitoring Integration**: Integrated Splunk for detailed logging and call tracking
   - **Deployment**: Deployed on OpenShift for dynamic scaling
   - **Dual API Support**: Maintained SOAP support via translation layer while offering direct RESTful API access

**Result:**
- **Observability**: Dramatically improved monitoring with Splunk integration and detailed call-level logging
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Reduced production issue resolution time by ~70% (from hours/days to minutes)
- **Customer Impact**: Minimized disruption - customers could continue using SOAP without any changes
- **Scalability**: System could now dynamically scale during peak hours via OpenShift
- **Customer Choice**: Provided migration path - customers who wanted to upgrade could directly use RESTful API, bypassing the translation layer
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improved customer relationships by understanding their constraints and providing solutions that worked for them
- **Technical Debt**: Significantly reduced technical debt while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Team Knowledge**: Helped new colleague understand the system through the modernization process
- **Business Impact**: Improved service reliability and reduced operational overhead

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Customer Obsession**: Understanding customer constraints is as important as technical improvements
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions (translation layer) can enable modernization without forcing customer changes
- **Communication**: Multiple conversations with customers led to better understanding and solutions
- **Balance**: Successfully balanced technical improvements with customer needs
- **Ownership**: Took initiative to understand legacy system and propose improvements
- **Think Big**: Proposed comprehensive modernization while considering all stakeholders

**Uber-Relevance:**
- **Customer Focus**: Prioritized customer needs and constraints (similar to Uber's focus on driver/rider experience)
- **Scale**: Handled multiple customers with different needs and constraints
- **Innovation**: Creative solution to enable modernization without disruption
- **Impact**: Quantifiable improvements (70% reduction in issue resolution time)
