# Spring Security

## Spring Security introduction [More](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-security)

`Spring Security` is a `bunch of servlet filters` that help you add `authentication` and `authorization` to your web application.

## talk about details how authentication and authorization works, login/ not login, permission/role, etc. (Interview question)

## Spring Security Flow

### OAuth2

OAuth2 is a standard that allows users to grant access to their data to third parties. For example, you can grant access to your Google Calendar to a third party, so that they can read your calendar and display it in their app.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is a standard that allows you to encode data in a JSON format. It is often used to encode authentication information, like the username, the permissions, etc. It is often used in combination with OAuth2.

JWT mainly contains three parts:

- Header: contains information about the type of token and the hashing algorithm used to sign the token.

- Payload: contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. Claims can be things like the username, the permissions, etc.

- Signature: is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasnâ€™t changed along the way. (Created by hashing the header and the payload with a secret key)
