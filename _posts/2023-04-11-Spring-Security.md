# Spring Security

## Spring Security introduction [More](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-security)

`Spring Security` is a framework to protect our endpoints.

## talk about details how authentication and authorization works, login/ not login, permission/role, etc. (Interview question)

1. user want to login in with username and password: first it will be filtered by the filter chain.

- UserDetailsService loadUserByUsername() to load user information from database, and then compare the credentials.

- AuthenticationManager authenticate() to authenticate the user and generate UserDetails object with GrantedAuthority.

- JwtTokenUtil generateToken() to generate token with UserDetails.

2. user want to access the endpoint with token: first it will be filtered by the filter chain.

- JwtTokenUtil resolve() the token from request and generate the userDetails object.

- generate authentication object and set the authentication object to SecurityContext.

For authroization, we can use `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")` or `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('unverified')")` to check the role of the user. Also, we can use `@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails userDetails` to get the user details in the controller.

### OAuth2

OAuth2 is a standard that allows users to grant access to their data to third parties. For example, you can grant access to your Google Calendar to a third party, so that they can read your calendar and display it in their app.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is a standard that allows you to encode data in a JSON format. It is often used to encode authentication information, like the username, the permissions, etc. It is often used in combination with OAuth2.

JWT mainly contains three parts:

- Header: contains information about the type of token and the hashing algorithm used to sign the token.

- Payload: contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. Claims can be things like the username, the permissions, etc.

- Signature: is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasnâ€™t changed along the way. (Created by hashing the header and the payload with a secret key)
