# Monolith VS Microservices

## Monolith

A monolithic application is built as a single unit. Everything is packaged together and runs as a single service.

    Advantages:
    - Easy to develop, deploy and test, debug
    - Easy to scale horizontally

    Disadvantages:
    - Hard to scale specific components independently, you have to scale the whole application
    - Hard to adopt new technologies, not good for decoupling
    - Hard to maintain, it has larger codebase

## Microservices

A microservice is a small, loosely coupled, distributed service. Each service is self-contained and handle a single business.

    Advantages:
    - Easy to scale specific components independently by duplicating the single service
    - Easy to adopt new technologies, good for decoupling
    - Easy to maintain, it has smaller codebase because each time you only need to maintain a single service

    Disadvantages:
    - It is more complex to develop, deploy and test, debug
    - Hard to scale horizontally
