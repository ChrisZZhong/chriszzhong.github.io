# Monolith VS Microservices

## Monolith

Monolithic means asingle server handle multiple business logic. It is tightly coupled. It is suitable for small applications that do not need to scale or handle high throughput. It is easy to develop and deploy compared to microservices.

## Microservices

Microservice is a distributed architecture, each service responsible for a single business logic. It is loosely coupled which is easy to add more features and scale specific components independently. The disadvantage is that it needs well designed and more complex to develop.
