## Docker

Docker is basically a tool that lets you package up an app with everything it needs—code, libraries, settings, So wherever you run it—on your laptop, a server, or in the cloud—it behaves the same way

## image vs container

a running image is called container, a container is an instance of image.

For example, image is executable file on you system, container is the process that runs the fils.

## workflow

Docker is Client-server model, three ways to interact with it:

1. Docker desktop GUI
2. command line
3. restful api

Docker deamon is the resource manager, it received requests and execute it.

What we need to do is have a `Dockerfile`, with no extention.

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/my-springboot-app.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

build the image using dockerfile and publish it to the dockerhub (`registry`)

## Docker compose

Docker compose is used to solve communication between containers. It can deploy multi-container applications at one time instead of running each container manually.

need a use a yaml file to set the configurations
