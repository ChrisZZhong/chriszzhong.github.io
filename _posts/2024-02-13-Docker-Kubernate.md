## Docker

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows developers to build, package, and distribute applications as containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run an application.

Docker containers are similar to virtual machines, but they are more portable, efficient, and easy to use. They are isolated from each other and from the host system, and they share the same kernel.

### What are the benefits of using Docker?

- Consistency: Docker containers provide a consistent environment for applications, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
- Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications between environments.
- Scalability: Docker containers can be easily scaled up or down to meet the demands of the application.

### What is a Docker image?

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application. It contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker images are used to create Docker containers.

### What is a Docker container?

A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application. Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, and they share the same kernel.

### How to create a Docker image?

To create a Docker image, you need to write a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains the instructions for building the image. The Dockerfile specifies the base image, the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies, and any other configuration settings.

Once you have written the Dockerfile, you can use the `docker build` command to build the image. For example:

```bash
docker build -t myapp .
```

This command builds the image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it with the name `myapp`.
