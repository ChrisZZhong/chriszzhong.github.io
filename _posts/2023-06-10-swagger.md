# Swagger

## What is Swagger?

Swagger is a tool that can be used to `document APIs`. It can be used to generate documentation for APIs. Swagger can also be used to test api endpoints on the swagger UI.

## How to use Swagger in Spring Boot?

To use swagger:

1.  Add dependency to the pom.xml file.

2.  Add annotation to the entrance of the application.  
    `@EnableSwagger`
3.  Add annotation to the controller class.  
    `@Api(value = "Controller Name", description = "Description of the controller")`
4.  Add the following annotation to the method of the controller class.

    `1.@ApiOperation(value = "Description of the method", response = Response.class)`

    `2.@ApiResponses()`

    `3.@ApiParam()`

5.  Run the application and go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
