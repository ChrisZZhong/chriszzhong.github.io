## management system OOD

Gym, Parking lot, Hotel, Library, Restaurant, etc.

When get the problem, think about if there is a management role in the system. If yes, it belongs to management system.

This kind of questions are frequently asked in interviews.

1. Clarify the requirements - What and How

   > Design a parking lot.

   think about the nouns. --> `parking lot`, and the noun related to the management - `Vehicle`

2. Core objects - input and output

   input : parking request  
   output: parking ticket/ `receipt`

3. Cases - use case

   - Reserve
   - Serve
   - Checkout

4. Class - UML Diagram

   `receipt` is important in magament system. It can be used to store the relationship between the management object and the user (book - user).

   create a class `receipt` (many-to-many) instead of put one inside of the other (one-to-many).

### Clarify

**`What`** : keyword is parking lot.

What does parking lot manage? --> `Vehicle` / `ParkingSpot`

for `ParkingLot`, what kind of parkingLot? --> multiple levels? (for some parking lots, one space may have upper space and lower space)

for `Vehicle`, what kind of vehicle? --> `Car` / `Truck` / `Motorcycle`

for `ParkingSpot`, what kind of parkingSpot? --> one spot for one car? or two spots for a bus?

**Example:**

> Design a parking lot with multi-levels, vehicle has three types: car, truck, motorcycle.

**`How`** : think about the rules

1. How to park? to park a vehicle, we need to find a parking spot first. So parking lot should shows the available spots in each level.

2. How to charge? Free or charge by hour?

### Core objects

Bus, car, motorcycle --> parking lot --> parking spot

prevent unnecessary objects.

bad example: parkinglot class contains a list of cars, we don't need to store the cars in parkinglot class. Also this is tightly coupled.

Instead, we use a `receipt` class to store the relationship between the parkinglot and the car.

The final design is like this:
