## management system OOD

Gym, Parking lot, Hotel, Library, Restaurant, etc.

When get the problem, think about if there is a management role in the system. If yes, it belongs to management system.

This kind of questions are frequently asked in interviews.

1. Clarify the requirements - What and How

   > Design a parking lot.

   think about the nouns. --> `parking lot`, and the noun related to the management - `Vehicle`

2. Core objects - input and output

   input : parking request  
   output: parking ticket/ `receipt`

3. Cases - use case

   - Reserve
   - Serve
   - Checkout

4. Class - UML Diagram

   `receipt` is important in magament system. It can be used to store the relationship between the management object and the user (book - user).

   create a class `receipt` (many-to-many) instead of put one inside of the other (one-to-many).

### Clarify

**`What`** : keyword is parking lot.

What does parking lot manage? --> `Vehicle` / `ParkingSpot`

for `ParkingLot`, what kind of parkingLot? --> multiple levels? (for some parking lots, one space may have upper space and lower space)

for `Vehicle`, what kind of vehicle? --> `Car` / `Truck` / `Motorcycle`

for `ParkingSpot`, what kind of parkingSpot? --> one spot for one car? or two spots for a bus?

**Example:**

> Design a parking lot with multi-levels, vehicle has three types: car, truck, motorcycle.

**`How`** : think about the rules

1. How to park? to park a vehicle, we need to find a parking spot first. So parking lot should shows the available spots in each level.

2. How to charge? Free or charge by hour?

### Core objects

Bus, car, motorcycle --> parking lot --> parking spot

prevent unnecessary objects.

bad example: parkinglot class contains a list of cars, we don't need to store the cars in parkinglot class. Also this is tightly coupled.

Instead, we use a `receipt` class to store the relationship between the parkinglot and the car.

The final design is like this:

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_parkingLot_classes.png">

### Cases

Two ways to think about the cases: Think as a user, or think as a manager.

1. As a user, I want to park my car, I need to find a parking spot first, then park my car. When I leave, I need to pay the fee, get the receipt.

2. As the problem itself, when a car comes, I need to find a parking spot for it. When the car leaves, charge the car, update the parking spot status.

During the interview, the second way is better.

```
For cars, we don't need it to provide any fuctions.

For parkingLot:
    - Get available spots
    - Park a vehicle
    - Clear a spot
    - calculate fee
```

Management common cases:

- Reservation: X (ask interviewer)

- Serve: Park vehicle, get available spots

- Checkout: Clear spot, calculate fee

### Class

```
1. Get available spots

parkingLot:
    - List<Spot> spots;
    - int availableSpots; add an attribute to store the available spots
---------------
    + int getAvailableSpots(); add a get method to get the available spots

Since it is multi-level parking lot, we create a class `Level` to store the spots in each level. And parkingLot contains a list of levels.
```

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_management_levelClass.png">

2. Park a vehicle

- check the size of the vehicle

  - car object --> size, getSize()

- find a spot for the vehicle

  - parkingLot --> findSpot()
  - level --> findSpot()
  - spot --> isAvailable()

- park the vehicle
  - parkingLot --> park(vehicle)
  - spot --> park(vehicle)
  - spot --> free()

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_management_cars.png">

For Vehicle, three types of vehicle should extend the interface Vehicle.

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_management_vehicle.png">

3. Clear a spot

- Parking lot find the spot to clear

- update the spot status to available

if do not use receipt, we need to put spot in the vehicle class. Here we use receipt to store the relationship between spot and vehicle, update the UMl diagram:

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_management_ticket.png">

4. Calculate fee

- parkingLot --> calculateFee(receipt)

calculateFee based on the start time and current time, times the rate.

### Correctness

- Validate the use cases
- Follow good practices
- SOLID principles
- Design patterns

To add more features, we can set the parking lot as a singleton class

## Reservations system

common problems: Hotel, Restaurant.

let's start from a simple one: Restaurant (without reservation).

### Clarify

`What`：Restaurant

What size of the tables, how many people can sit in one table?

`How`：

Does it have reservation system? --> No

### Core objects

Think in this way: (this is actually the use case)

```
1. When party comes, find a table for them.
2. party have the menu, order meals, return the meals they ordered.
3. check out, clear the table.
```

`Restaurant`, `party`, `table`，`meal`, `order`.

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_reservation_core_objects.png">

### Cases

This step always comes with the core objects.

```
1. When a party comes, restaurant needs to find a table for them. --> find table
2. Party orders meals. --> order meals
3. finish the meal, check out. --> check out
```

### Class

1. find table

find a table, mark the table as occupied, return the table.

```
For Restaurant:
   - Add a method `findTable()` in restaurant class, return a Table object.
For Table:
   - Add a boolean attribute `available` in table class and a method `isAvailable()`.
```

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_reservation_findTable.png">

2. order meals

order take a list of meals and return a order receipt.

```
For Restaurant:
   - Add a method `orderMeal()` in restaurant class, return an Order object.
For Order:
   - add a field `List<Meal> meals`
   - add a field `int id`
   - add a field `int tableId`
```

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_reservation_orderMeal.png">

3. check out

get the total price of the meals, clear the table.

```
For Restaurant:
   - Add a method `checkOut(int tableID)` in restaurant class, no return.
For Table:
   - Add a method `clearTable()` in table class, no return. (or use the occupiedOrUnoccupied method)
For Order:
   - Add a method `calculatePrice()` in order class, return the price.
```

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_reservation_checkOut.png">

### Correctness

review the use cases, follow good practices, SOLID principles, design patterns

---

Now let's add the reservation system. For the reservation system, we can think in this way:

```
Search criteria -> Search() -> List<Result> -> Select() -> Receipt
```

**search criteria**: `number of people`, `date`, `time`, etc.

```
number of people: each table is the same size, the number of people would not exceed the table size.
date: What is the latest date we can reserve? --> 1 month
time: Does all time are available? --> Yes, we can reserve any time.
```

**Search()**: search the available tables based on the search criteria.

```
Add a method `findTableForReservation(Timeslot timeslot, int people)` in restaurant class,

1. return a List<Timeslot> (Reservation) object.

How long is the timeslot? --> 2 hours

2. Or we can go to the confirmation page directly. Or show not available message (throw exceptions).
```

```
Add Reservation class:
   - add a field `int id`
   - add a field `int tableId`
   - add a field `Timeslot timeslot`
For Restaurant:
   - Add a method `findTableForReservation(Timeslot timeslot, int people)` in restaurant class, return a Reservation object.
   - Add a method `confirmReservation(Reservation reservation)` in restaurant class, return a Receipt object/ nothing.
Add NoTableAvailableException class
```

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_reservation_reservation.png">

How do we know if the table is available?

```
For Table:
   - add a field `List<Timeslot> reservedTimeslots`
```

<img src="/images/OOD/OOD_reservation_table.png">

To cancel the reservation, we can add a method in restaurant class:

```
add a method `cancelReservation(Reservation r)` in restaurant class, no return

```
