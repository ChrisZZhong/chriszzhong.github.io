## management system OOD

Gym, Parking lot, Hotel, Library, Restaurant, etc.

When get the problem, think about if there is a management role in the system. If yes, it belongs to management system.

This kind of questions are frequently asked in interviews.

1. Clarify the requirements - What and How

   > Design a parking lot.

   think about the nouns. --> `parking lot`, and the noun related to the management - `Vehicle`

2. Core objects - input and output

   input : parking request  
   output: parking ticket/ `receipt`

3. Cases - use case

   - Reserve
   - Serve
   - Checkout

4. Class - UML Diagram

   `receipt` is important in magament system. It can be used to store the relationship between the management object and the user (book - user).

   create a class `receipt` (many-to-many) instead of put one inside of the other (one-to-many).

### Clarify

**`What`** : keyword is parking lot.

What does parking lot manage? --> `Vehicle` / `ParkingSpot`

for `ParkingLot`, what kind of parkingLot? --> multiple levels? (for some parking lots, one space may have upper space and lower space)

for `Vehicle`, what kind of vehicle? --> `Car` / `Truck` / `Motorcycle`

for `ParkingSpot`, what kind of parkingSpot? --> one spot for one car? or two spots for a bus?

**Example:**

> Design a parking lot with multi-levels, vehicle has three types: car, truck, motorcycle.

**`How`** : think about the rules

1. How to park? to park a vehicle, we need to find a parking spot first. So parking lot should shows the available spots in each level.

2. How to charge? Free or charge by hour?

### Core objects

Bus, car, motorcycle --> parking lot --> parking spot

prevent unnecessary objects.

bad example: parkinglot class contains a list of cars, we don't need to store the cars in parkinglot class. Also this is tightly coupled.

Instead, we use a `receipt` class to store the relationship between the parkinglot and the car.

The final design is like this:

### Cases

Two ways to think about the cases: Think as a user, or think as a manager.

1. As a user, I want to park my car, I need to find a parking spot first, then park my car. When I leave, I need to pay the fee, get the receipt.

2. As the problem itself, when a car comes, I need to find a parking spot for it. When the car leaves, charge the car, update the parking spot status.

During the interview, the second way is better.

```
For cars, we don't need it to provide any fuctions.

For parkingLot:
    - Get available spots
    - Park a vehicle
    - Clear a spot
    - calculate fee
```

Management common cases:

- Reservation: X (ask interviewer)

- Serve: Park vehicle, get available spots

- Checkout: Clear spot, calculate fee

### Class

```
1. Get available spots

parkingLot:
    - List<Spot> spots;
    - int availableSpots; add an attribute to store the available spots
---------------
    + int getAvailableSpots(); add a get method to get the available spots

Since it is multi-level parking lot, we create a class `Level` to store the spots in each level. And parkingLot contains a list of levels.
```

2. Park a vehicle

- check the size of the vehicle

  - car object --> size, getSize()

- find a spot for the vehicle

  - parkingLot --> findSpot()
  - level --> findSpot()
  - spot --> isAvailable()

- park the vehicle
  - parkingLot --> park(vehicle)
  - spot --> park(vehicle)
  - spot --> free()

For Vehicle, three types of vehicle should extend the interface Vehicle.

3. Clear a spot

- Parking lot find the spot to clear

- update the spot status to available

if do not use receipt, we need to put spot in the vehicle class. Here we use receipt to store the relationship between spot and vehicle, update the UMl diagram:

4. Calculate fee

- parkingLot --> calculateFee(receipt)

calculateFee based on the start time and current time, times the rate.

### Correctness

- Validate the use cases
- Follow good practices
- SOLID principles
- Design patterns

To add more features, we can set the parking lot as a singleton class
