## Set up env (virtual environment)

```shell
$ python -m venv env  # Windows

$ python3 -m venv env  # Linux or macOS
```

In python, there is no central lib management tools like Maven in Java, and it is not possible to have different version of same lib, so we need to create a env to manage the lib we use in this project
