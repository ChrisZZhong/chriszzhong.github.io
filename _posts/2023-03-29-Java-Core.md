## Final, Finally, Finalize

- `final` is a keyword to declare a constant variable, a method or a class.

  1. final variable: value (reference) cannot be changed once assigned.
  2. final method: cannot be overridden.
  3. final class: cannot be extended by other class

- `finally` is used at the end of the try-catch block to execute the code within it regardless of the result of the try-catch block.

- `finalize` is a method of Object class that is called by the garbage collector when the object is no longer referenced. Use try with resource instead, because finalize() calling is unpredictable, sometimes will cause GC pause.

## Immutable Class

**Definition**: Immutable Class is a class whose instances (objects) **cannot be modified after they are created.**

**Example**: Wrapper classes, String (Security reason, hashcode)

### How to create Immutable Class

1. Declare the class as final so it canâ€™t be extended.

2. Make all fields private and final.

3. No setter methods. All variables are set in the constructor with the deep copy of the input.

4. Return copies of feild data in getter methods.

### Why String is immutable in Java?

1. `Security concern`: sensitive information such as password, network connection, etc. Being immutable prevents malicious code from modifuing sensitive information.

2. `Thread safe`: Immutable objects are by default thread safe, can be shared among multiple threads.

3. `Hashcode`: String is widely used as key in Map and other collection classes. Being immutable guarantees that hashcode will always be same so that it can be cached without worrying about the changes.

4. `String Pool`: Save the runtime memory by reusing strings.
   > Java uses a string pool to store and reuse string literals. When you create a string, Java checks if it already exists in the string pool. If it does, the existing instance is returned, if not, a new instance is created.

## String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder

> They both used to store string values

- `String` is immutable, used to store values with fixed size. (Security reason, Thread safe, Hashcode, String Pool)

- `StringBuffer` used when we do not need to consider the thread safety, and when we need to frequently modify the content of the string.

- `StringBuilder` used in multi-threaded environment, when we need to frequently modify the content of the string.
