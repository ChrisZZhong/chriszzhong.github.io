## What is your daily life like?

We hold daily standard meetings at 10 am, and after that we may have some one-on-one meetings with coworkers or with the external team in the afternoon. At other times, I am working on my own tasks, like coding, write docs, or do some research and code review. Also there will be the weekly meeting on Thursday afternoon.

We work in Agile, we have a sprint every two weeks. We hold planning meetings ahead of each sprint and review meetings at the end of each sprint. After each quarter around three months, we have retrospective meeting to discuss the following sprints and the goals for the next quarter.

## How do you test or deploy your code?

I am responsible for unit tests, and I will run the test to achieve 90% code coverage. For other tests like integration tests or API tests, we have a CI/CD pipeline, which will run other tests automatically (this is provided by the QA team). After making sure the unit test passed, I will commit the code to my branch (it will trigger the automation tests) and create a pull request. Then I will ask my team members to review my code. After that, I will merge the code to the master branch. After several commits, we will release the new version to the production environment.

## What is the most challenging thing you have done?
