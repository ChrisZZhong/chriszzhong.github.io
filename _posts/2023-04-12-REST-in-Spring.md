# REST Controller in Spring

## @RestController VS @Controller

`@RestController` is a convenience annotation that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

`@Controller` is a common annotation that is used to mark a class as Spring MVC Controller while `@ResponseBody` is used to indicate that the return value of a method should be used as the response body of the request.
